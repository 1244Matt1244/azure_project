## Main Objectives of the `azure_project` Repository

The `azure_project` repository is designed with several key objectives in mind, focusing on cost-efficiency, resource sharing, automation, education, and practical implementation within the context of Cloud DevOps using Azure. Below are the main objectives:

### 1. Demonstrate Cost-Efficiency

The repository aims to showcase how to set up Azure resources in a cost-effective manner. This is achieved through the use of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and PowerShell scripts, which ensure that resources are provisioned efficiently, minimizing unnecessary expenses.

### 2. Resource Sharing

The project is designed to facilitate resource sharing, a crucial aspect of Cloud DevOps. By setting up shared resources such as SQL databases and Web Apps within a single resource group, it demonstrates how multiple services can be efficiently managed and shared across different applications or environments.

### 3. Automation

The use of PowerShell scripts and ARM templates automates the process of creating and managing Azure resources. This automation reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and enhances reliability in resource provisioning, making it easier to scale and manage resources over time.

### 4. Education and Skill Demonstration

The repository serves as an educational tool, showcasing the user's skills in Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, PowerShell scripting, and Cloud DevOps practices. It provides a practical example that can be used to learn and demonstrate proficiency in these areas, making it valuable for both personal and professional development.

### 5. Practical Implementation

The repository provides a hands-on implementation of Azure resource management, which can be used as a reference or starting point for other Cloud DevOps projects. It helps users understand the practical aspects of setting up and managing Azure resources, making it a valuable asset for potential employers and collaborators.
